# Next-word-predictor
Predicting the next word using a sequence if characters

## Overview
This mission demonstrates the implementation of a subsequent word Prediction version the usage of TensorFlow and Streamlit. The version is designed to predict the subsequent phrase in a given textual content sequence, making use of LSTM (long short-term memory) layers for processing sequences and dense layers for classification. The version is deployed in an interactive web interface the use of Streamlit, permitting customers to input text and acquire actual-time tips for the following phrase.

## Features
Sequential Data Preprocessing: Tokenizes and processes text data into sequences for model training.
>Customizable Model Architecture: Allows users to choose the number of LSTM and Dense layers, as well as the output dimensions.
>Real-time Word Prediction: Provides next-word predictions based on user input through a Streamlit interface.
>Model Persistence: Saves the trained model and tokenizer for future use.
